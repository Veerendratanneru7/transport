# MT Transport Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains project documentation for the MT Transport application. Use this space to capture architecture decisions, onboarding notes, deployment guides, and any other references that help contributors understand and maintain the system. Current planning includes both the existing web application and a forthcoming mobile app, so document mobile-specific architecture and workflows alongside web details.

## Suggested Structure

- `architecture/` – Diagrams and explanations of system components.
- `guides/` – How-to documents for common workflows.
- `reference/` – API references, data models, and configuration details.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Follow Markdown formatting and keep titles consistent.
2. Include diagrams or code snippets where they clarify complex topics.
3. Link related documents so readers can easily navigate the documentation.

## Getting Started

- Review `README.md` at the repository root for setup instructions.
